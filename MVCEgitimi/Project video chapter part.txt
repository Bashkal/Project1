Yes, you **can** build an ASP.NET MVC application that allows:

* Uploading and storing documents (PDF, Word) and videos
* Reading/viewing the documents online
* Watching videos with **chapter support**, similar to YouTube’s video chapters
* Editing metadata (titles, chapters, etc.)
* Seeking inside videos based on chapters
* Downloading files

To address your main point: **Yes, it's possible to implement chapters for videos**, but it requires **manual or semi-automated support**, since ASP.NET MVC and C# don't have built-in "video chapter" features like YouTube. Here’s a step-by-step concept.

### 🔧 High-Level Architecture

1. **Frontend (HTML + JavaScript):**

   * HTML5 `<video>` player for playback
   * JavaScript for chapter navigation UI

2. **Backend (ASP.NET MVC + C#):**

   * Upload system for documents/videos
   * Database to store file metadata (chapters, titles, etc.)
   * Admin interface to define/edit chapters
   * APIs to serve file data and chapters

3. **Storage:**

   * Files stored locally or in cloud (Azure Blob, AWS S3)
   * Database (e.g. SQL Server) for metadata and chapter timestamps

### 📽️ How to Handle Video Chapters

#### ✅ 1. **Store Chapter Metadata**

Create a database table like:

```sql
VideoChapters (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    VideoId INT, -- foreign key to video file
    ChapterTitle NVARCHAR(255),
    StartTimeSeconds INT
)
```

#### ✅ 2. **Frontend Playback with Chapters**

Use `<video>` tag with JavaScript to create a chapter navigation UI. Example:

```html
<video id="myVideo" controls width="640" height="360">
    <source src="/videos/lesson1.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<ul id="chapters">
    <!-- Chapters loaded dynamically -->
</ul>

<script>
    const chapters = [
        { title: "Introduction", time: 0 },
        { title: "Topic 1", time: 120 },
        { title: "Topic 2", time: 300 }
    ];

    const video = document.getElementById("myVideo");
    const chapterList = document.getElementById("chapters");

    chapters.forEach(chapter => {
        const li = document.createElement("li");
        li.innerText = chapter.title;
        li.onclick = () => video.currentTime = chapter.time;
        chapterList.appendChild(li);
    });
</script>
```

You can generate this list from the server dynamically via an MVC controller or Web API.

### 🖼️ Admin UI for Uploading + Chapter Input

* Let users upload video
* After upload, allow them to add chapters (with UI to input title + time, e.g. "3:15")
* Save this info to DB
* Show chapters on the frontend as in the example above

You might also look into FFmpeg if you want to extract timestamps or automate chapter generation, but that would require more advanced processing.

---

### 📚 Document Support

* PDF/Word can be uploaded and stored
* Use iframe or embedded viewers (e.g. [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/), Office Online viewer) for displaying in-browser
* MVC controllers for upload/download operations

---

### 🧱 Technologies You’ll Use

* ASP.NET MVC (or ASP.NET Core MVC)
* Entity Framework for DB
* HTML5 + JavaScript
* Bootstrap for layout
* Optional: SignalR for real-time updates or FFmpeg for video processing

---

### 🧪 Optional: Automating Chapter Detection

For advanced features (like auto-detecting topics via AI), you'd need:

* Transcription (Azure Video Indexer, Whisper, or similar)
* NLP to split transcript into topics
* Store and use timestamps as chapters

But for now, manual chapter input is very doable and practical for your case.

---

### ✅ Summary

Yes, you can implement chapter support in your ASP.NET MVC web app. Here's what you need:

* Video player with chapter control (via JavaScript)
* Database schema to store chapters
* Admin UI to manage chapters per video
* ASP.NET MVC backend to serve and manage all data

Would you like a **sample project structure** or some **starter code** for this?
